ABOUT
MyIP it's a small application that answers the question "What is my IP address?".

From time to time there is a need to get to know your IP address. E.g. to establish the connection between two computers over the Internet, or if the user isn't experienced in all that networking stuff to pass the IP information for a technical assistant. This app shows IP addresses available on user's PC.

There are two different types of IPs internal and external.

Internal IP - is the IP of the local machine. There can be more than one internal IP address, due to several network connections (or adapters).

External IP - is the IP of the PC that other machines from the Internet see. It can be different from the internal one because of provider or intermediate devices (e.g. routers). 


LOCALIZATION
By the default MyIP has two localisations: English and Russian. But you can make a translation in other language. 
In order to do this you need to:
- head to /Localizations sub-folder, 
- copy file with the name of language you familiar with;
- open the file in your favorite text-editor (the file is in xml-format);
- edit entries in brackets as it shown in the following example: 
  before: "<Example>example</Example>" after: "<Example>пример</Example>"
- save the file under the name of translated language;
- select language in the application settings.
